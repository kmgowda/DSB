# MicrosoftSQL Performance Benchmarking using SBK
The MicrosoftSQL driver for SBK supports multiple writers and multiple readers performance benchmarking. But, the End to End Latency benchmarking is not supported.
The MicrosoftSQL driver uses the auto incrementing index are primary key to support multiple writers.
The MicrosoftSQL driver uses the JDBC for IO operations.

As an example, to start the MSSQL storage server as a container is as follows:

```
docker run -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=root@1234' -p 1433:1433 -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
```

An example, SBK benchmarking command is
```
./build/install/sbk/bin/sbk -class mssql  -size 100 -writers 1 -seconds 60 
```

by default, the SBK uses the url: jdbc:sqlserver://localhost:1433, and default table name is 'test'
the default username is 'sa' and the default password is 'root@1234'

Sample SBK MicrosoftSQL write output is follows

```
