# MongoDB performance benchmarking with SBK
The MongoDB driver for SBK supports single/multiple Writer , single/multiple reader performance benchmarking.

## setting up  MongoDB local Docker server
To make simple demo/test, you can run the local MongoDB server docker image as follows:

```
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:27017:27017/tcp  --name kmg-mongo -d mongo:latest
```

make sure that you have redirected the port 27017 from docker to local system

Now, you can run the MongoDB writer benchmarking as follows. 
```
kmg@W10GRDN6H2:~/kmg-linux/SBK$ ./build/install/sbk/bin/sbk -class mongodb -writers 1 -size 100 -seconds 60

## FoundationDB Document layer performance benchmarking
The SBK MongoDB driver can be used conduct the performance benchmarking of FoundationDB Document layer.
Note that default port for Foundation DB document layer is 27016 (not 27017).
Refer to this document: https://foundationdb.github.io/fdb-document-layer/getting-started-linux.html for setting for FoundationDB document layer cluster
