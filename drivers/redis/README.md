# Redis Performance benchmarking using SBK
The Redis driver for SBK supports multi writers and readers performance benchmarking.
The Redis pub sub is used for end to end latency benchmarking.


An example, SBK benchmarking command is
```
./build/install/sbk/bin/sbk -class redis -size 10 -writers 1 -seconds 60
```

by default, the SBK uses the local Redis Server: 127.0.0.1:6379, and default list name is 'list-1'


Sample SBK Redis write benchmarking output

```
kmg@kmgs-MBP SBK % ./build/install/sbk/bin/sbk -class redis -size 10 -writers 1 -seconds 60
