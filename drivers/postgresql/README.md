# PostgreSQL Performance benchmarking using SBK
The PostgreSQL driver for SBK supports multiple writers and multiple readers performance benchmarking. But, the End to End Latency benchmarking is not supported.
The PostgreSQL driver uses the auto incrementing index are primary key to support multiple writers.
The PostgreSQL driver uses the JDBC for IO operations.

As an example, to start the PostgreSQL storage server as a container is as follows:

```
docker run  -p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432/tcp  --name kmg-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=root -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=root -d postgres
```

An example, SBK benchmarking command is
```
./build/install/sbk/bin/sbk -class postgresql  -size 100 -writers 1 -seconds 60 
```

by default, the SBK uses the url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres, and default table name is 'test'
the default username is 'root' and the default password is 'root'.

Sample SBK PostgeSQL write output is follows

```
