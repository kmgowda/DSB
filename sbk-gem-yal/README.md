# SBK-GEM-YAL : YML Arguments Loader

[![Api](https://img.shields.io/badge/SBK--GEM--YAL-API-brightgreen)](https://kmgowda.github.io/SBK/sbk-gem-yal/javadoc/index.html)

The SBK-GEM-YAL (YML Arguments Loader) is a wrapper for [SBK-GEM](https://github.com/kmgowda/SBK/tree/master/sbk-gem).
The SBK-GEM-YAL extracts arguments from the YML file and invokes the SBK-GEM command with the same arguments as command 
line parameters. you can store the SBK-GEM arguments in a YML file and can be given as input to SBK-GEM-YAL 
application/command. 
Use this example YML file [sbk-gem.yml](https://github.com/kmgowda/SBK/blob/master/sbk-gem-yal/sbk-gem.yml) to build 
your own YML file for SBK-GEM-YAL command/application.

## Build SBK-GEM-YAL
SBK-GEM-YAL is a submodule/project of the SBK framework. If you  [build SBK](./../README.md#build-sbk), it builds 
the SBK-GEM-YAL package too.

## Running SBK-GEM-YAL locally
The standard help output with SBK-GEM-YAL parameters as follows
