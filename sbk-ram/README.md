# SBK-RAM : Results Aggregation Monitor

[![Api](https://img.shields.io/badge/SBK--RAM-API-brightgreen)](https://kmgowda.github.io/SBK/sbk-ram/javadoc/index.html)
[![SBK-RAM Dockers](https://img.shields.io/badge/SBK--RAM-Dockers-blue)](https://hub.docker.com/r/kmgowda/sbk-ram)

The SBK (Storage Benchmark Kit) - RAM (Results Aggregation Monitor) combines the performance results supplied from
multiple SBK instances. The SBK-RAM is the GRPC Server. Multiple SBK instances can log the performance results to a
single SBM-RAM Server. The SBK-RAM determines the cumulative throughput and latency percentile values. Each SBK
instance reports all the latency values in bulk and SBK-RAM integrates all latency records and determines the
performance values for the whole SBK cluster (multi SBK instances). The SBK-RAM is useful if you want to stress the
storage server / Storage cluster with multiple storage clients (SBK instances) and analyse the throughput and
latency percentiles for the entire storage cluster/server. SBK-RAM logs the integrated results to standard output device/logger and to the grafana through prometheus metrics.

## Build SBK-RAM
SBK-RAM is a submodule/project of the SBK framework. If you [build SBK](./../README.md#build-sbk), it builds the SBK-RAM server too.

## Running SBK-RAM locally
The standard help output with SBK-RAM parameters as follows

Note that the SBK-RAM indicates the number of active connections and maximum connections in a session.
while running an SBK instance make sure that you supply the RAM Host address (IP address). Optionally you supply the
port number too , the default port number is **9717**.

A sample SBK instance execution output is as follows:

```

Note that option **-ram** is used to supply the SBK-RAM host ; In the above example, its localhost and default port is 9717.

### SBK-RAM Grafana Dashboards
when you run the SBK-RAM, by default it starts the http server and all the output benchmark data is directed to the default port number: **9719** and **metrics** context.
If you want to change the port number and context, you can use the command line argument **-context** to change the same.
you have to run the prometheus monitoring system (server [default port number is 9090] cum client) which pulls/fetches the benchmark data from the local/remote http server.
If you want to include additional SBK-RAM nodes/instances to fetch the performance data or from port number other than **9719**, you need to extend or update [ram-targets.json](https://github.com/kmgowda/SBK/blob/master/grafana/prometheus/ram-targets.json)
In case, if you are fetching metrics/benchmark data from remote http server , or from the context other than **metrics** then you need to change the [default prometheus server configuration](https://github.com/kmgowda/SBK/blob/master/grafana/prometheus/prometheus.yml) too.
Run the grafana server (cum a client) to fetch the benchmark data from prometheus.
For example, if you are running a local grafana server then by default it fetches the data from the prometheus server at the local port 9090.
You can access the local grafana server at localhost:3000 in your browser using **admin/admin** as default username / password.
You can import the grafana dashboards to fetch the SBK and SBK-RAM benchmark data of the existing supported storage drivers from [grafana dashboards](https://github.com/kmgowda/SBK/tree/master/grafana/dashboards).

The SBK-RAM (Server side) and SBK (client side) can use the same dashboard for a selected storage driver/device. for SBK-RAM , these grafana dashboards shows the number of active and maximum connections.
The sample output of 2 SBK instances of file system benchmark data with grafana is below

[![SBK-RAM file system Dashboard](images/sbk-ram-file-grafana.png)](https://github.com/kmgowda/SBK/tree/master/sbk-ram/images/sbk-ram-file-grafana.png)

### SBK-RAM JMX Exporter and Grafana
The SBK can start the java agent to export the JVM metrics to Grafana via Prometheus. you just have build with
parameter **-PjmxExport=true** while building SBK. Refer : [build SBK with JMX](./../README.md#SBK with JMX exporter and Grafana)
All the SBK-RAM JVM metrics will be available at http://localhost:8719/metrics The network port **8719** to used to 
expose the metrics.  use [SBK-RAM-JMX grafana dashboard](./../grafana/dashboards/sbk-ram-jmx-metrics.json) to 
analyse the SBK-RAM JVM metrics.


## SBK-RAM Docker Containers

you can build the sbk docker image using 'docker' command as follows
```
docker build -f ./dockers/sbk-ram <root directory> --tag <tag name>
```

example docker command is
```
docker build -f ./dockers/sbk-ram ./ --tag sbk-ram
```

you can  run the docker image too, For example
```
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:9717:9717/tcp -p 127.0.0.1:9719:9719/tcp kmgowda/sbk-ram:latest -class file -time ns
```
* Note that the option **-p 127.0.0.1:9719:9719/tcp** redirects the 9719 port to local port to send the performance
  metric data for Prometheus.
* Another option **-p 127.0.0.1:9717:9717/tcp** redirect the port 9717 port to local port to receive the performance
  results from SBK instances.
* Avoid using the **--network host** option , because this option overrides the port redirection.


### SBK-RAM docker hub

The SBK-RAM Docker images are available at [SBK Docker](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kmgowda/sbk-ram)

The SBK docker image pull command is
```
docker pull kmgowda/sbk-ram
```

you can straightaway run the docker image too, For example
```
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:9717:9717/tcp -p 127.0.0.1:9719:9719/tcp kmgowda/sbk-ram:latest -class file -time ns
```
* Note that the option **-p 127.0.0.1:9719:9719/tcp** redirects the 9719 port to local port to send the performance
  metric data for Prometheus.
* Another option **-p 127.0.0.1:9717:9717/tcp** redirect the port 9717 port to local port to receive the performance
  results from SBK instances.
* Avoid using the **--network host** option , because this option overrides the port redirection.


###  SBK-RAM Docker Compose
The SBK-RAM docker compose consists of SBK-RAM docker image, Grafana and prometheus docker images.
The [grafana image](https://github.com/kmgowda/SBK/blob/master/grafana/Dockerfile) contains the [dashboards](https://github.com/kmgowda/SBK/tree/master/grafana/dashboards) which can be directly deployed for the performance analytics.

As an example, just follow the below steps to see the performance graphs

1. In the sbk-ram directory build the 'sbk-ram' service of the [docker compose](https://github.com/kmgowda/SBK/blob/master/sbk-ram/docker-compose.yml) file as follows.

 ```
 <SBK dir>% docker-compose build

 ```

2. Run the 'sbk-ram' service as follows.

 ```
 <SBK dir>% docker-compose run -p 127.0.0.1:9717:9717/tcp sbk-ram -class file -time ns

 ```
Note that , 9717 is the exposed port from sbk-ram container to receive the benchmark results from remote SBK
instances via localhost.
The option **-class** is the same as in SBK command/application. you should use the same storage class and time unit in SBK instances too.

1. login to [grafana localhost port 3000](http://localhost:3000) with username **admin** and password **sbk**
1. go to dashboard menu and pick the dashboard of the storage device on which you are running the performance benchmarking.
   in the above example, you can choose the [File system dashboard](https://github.com/kmgowda/SBK/blob/master/grafana/dashboards/sbk-file.json).
1. The SBK-RAM docker compose runs the SBK-RAM image as a docker container.
   In case, if you are running SBK as an application, and you want to see the SBK performance graphs using Grafana,
   then use [Grafana Docker compose](https://github.com/kmgowda/SBK/tree/master/grafana)
